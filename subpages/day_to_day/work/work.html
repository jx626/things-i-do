        <h1>Working as a proofreader</h1>
        <div class="h1-body">
            <p>In most part of the day, I work with words, adding a classifier, oe replacing a period with a comma. In <em>Beautiful World, Where Are You?</em>, Rooney described Eileen as</p>

            <div class="quote"><em>who had always been quiet in school</em></div>

            <p>and when got to work, she would normally be</p>

            <div class="quote"><em>using the soft greasy roller on her computer mouse she skimmed over the document, eyes flicking back and forth across narrow columns of text, and occasionally she stopped, clicked, and inserted or deleted characters. Most frequently she was inserting two full stops into the name ‘WH Auden’, in order to standardise its appearance as ‘W.H. Auden’. When she reached the end of the document, she opened a search command, selected the Match Case option and searched: ‘WH’.</em></div>

            <p>My day-to-day work is more or less the same, opening several docs at the same time while scrutinizing every word choice for unnatural expressions, incorrect-but-no-one-seems-to-care punctuation errors, and cultural "mistakes" that people from time to time deliberately make. By everyone I meant myself included.</p>

            <p>The company, or the industry I'm in is not the best one for proofreading works because essentially not much people care what you do. It resembles very little of what happens in real literature, or who am I to say what really happens there? The work I am doing is essentially a self-deceit, a way to tell myself that I am capable of living on my sensitivity to words, my sharp observation to world affairs, to doctrines and disciplines, and an ability to express myself with trenchant arguments. It's a cover for my lack of courage and maybe ability to directly tackle the issues that bother me, and therefore to choose this path so that I can feel good of myself.</p>
                
            <p>Despite all these, my focus in the current job is still to expand instead of spending hours in search of the most precise counterpart of a source word. I still and always have the choice to keeping doing my job this way.</p>

            <p>What I wanted to do here is to share with you is the interesting perspectives I dive into during my work. But only those things that won't get the company to hunt me down across the ocean.</p>
