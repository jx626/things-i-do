        <h1>Working as a proofreader</h1>
        <p>In most part of the day, I work with words, adding a classifier here, replacing a period with a comma there. In <em>Beautiful World, Where Are You?</em>, Rooney described Eileen as <br>
            <br></p>
            <p><em>who had always been quiet in school</em><br>
            <br></p>
            <p>and when got to work, she would be<br>
            <br></p>
            <p><em>using the soft greasy roller on her computer mouse she skimmed over the document, eyes flicking back and forth across narrow columns of text, and occasionally she stopped, clicked, and inserted or deleted characters. Most frequently she was inserting two full stops into the name ‘WH Auden’, in order to standardise its appearance as ‘W.H. Auden’. When she reached the end of the document, she opened a search command, selected the Match Case option and searched: ‘WH’.</em><br>
            <br></p>
            <p>My day-to-day work is more or less the same, comparing several docs at the same time while scrutinizing every word choice for unnatural expressions, incorrect-but-no-one-cares punctuation errors, and does-not-matter-but-everyone-is-so-sensitive-about-it cultural "mistakes". By everyone I meant myself included.</p>
            <p>The company, or the industry I'm in is not the best one for proofreading works because essentially not much people cares what you do. The focus is still to expand instead of spending hours in search of the most precise counterpart of a source word. But nevertheless, I still and always have the choice to keeping doing my job this way.</p>
            <p>What I wanted to do here is to share with you is the interesting perspectives I dive into during my work. But only those things that won't get the company to hunt me down across the ocean.</p>
