        <h1>Why this</h1>
        <p>Compared with solely creating a recipe website, talking a bit about myself and what I've been up to day in and day out sounds more appealing, and narcissistic in essence. While I've been a listener for so long that I started to wonder what would happen I also go like me, me, me, me, me.
        <p>Calling yourself an enthusiast is somehow brutal, as if you're trying to burn the person who read this with all your passion and loneliness. While passion itself is beautiful. It drives you to the extreme and forces you to ignore the disciplines the society has taken you hostage of. You do stupid things, but stupid only to the outsiders. You are heavy-minded yet light-headed, and at the end of the day, exhausted and happy. This is the life I want to live. </p>

        <h1>So What <em>exactly</em> do you do in a day?</h1>
        <p>I read, play games and cook, which is too ideal. I work on average 10 hours a day with no overtime payment or job security, but I love my job.</p>

        <h2>An almost day-to-day</h2>

            <li>Markets or just walk around</li>
